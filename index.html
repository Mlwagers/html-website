				<h2>About Me</h2>
			
				Hi everyone! My name is <strong>Madison Wagers</strong> and I recently graduated from Eastern Kentucky University in December of 2022 with my bachelor's degree in elementary education. <br>Since then, I have been subbing for my local school district, and I am beyond excited to actually get started on my career and have my own classroom when the opportunity arises.</br>
				<p> In the future, when the time is right, I would love to be a school librarian! This will allow me to reach a <u><em>larger audience</em></u>. I will be able to help all students and staff in my school building succeed. </p>
				<p> Listed below are a few of my favorite things...
				<ul>
				<li> Reading </li>
				<li> Nature </li>
				<li> Spaghetti </li>
				<li> The color pink </li>
				<li> Roses </li>
				<li> Netflix </li>
